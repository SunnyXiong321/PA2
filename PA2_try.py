'''
PA2 --  Periodic Review
By: Sunny Xiong
What it does: It creates a flashcards for chemistry students to study for periodic table, 
where it'll provide the symbol and user answers the name
By doing this, the program needs to reads the text from either csv or txt files, play the 
flashcard game out, and record user history.
What went well: once the structure is clear, the coding became easy, the formatting part 
and the read files from csv/txt part is not hard
what would have made it even better: I would maybe create more decks for different classes 
for better user experience.
what you would do with more time to work: format it better, add some effects if they got right/wrong.
pledge: I neither given nor received help on this assignment except i let my friends look through and 
peer reviewed, I went on google and youtube to find tutorials, and went over with Mx.K.
